# Decision Trees


## Intro

Decision trees are recursive partitioning methods that divide the predictor spaces into simpler regions and can be visualized in a tree-like structure. Decision trees attempt to classify data by dividing it into subsets according to a Y output variable and based on some predictors.  

## Load packages

```{r load_packages}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
```

Let's see how a decision tree classifies diabetes status from our dataset.  

```{r setup_data}
# Load data we created in 02-preprocessing.Rmd.
# Objects: task_reg, task_class
load("data/preprocessed.RData")

# Pull out data for easier analysis.
train_x = task_class$data[task_class$train_rows, task_class$covariates]
train_y = task_class$data[task_class$train_rows, task_class$outcome]

test_x = task_class$data[-task_class$train_rows, task_class$covariates]
test_y = task_class$data[-task_class$train_rows, task_class$outcome]
```

```{r}
tree = rpart::rpart(train_y ~ ., data = train_x,
             # Use method = "anova" for a continuous outcome.
             method = "class",
             # Can use "gini" for gini coefficient.
             parms = list(split = "information")) 

# Here is the text-based display of the decision tree. Yikes!  :^( 
print(tree)
```

Although interpreting the text can be intimidating, a decision tree's main strength is its tree-like plot, which is much easier to interpret.

```{r plot_tree}
rpart.plot::rpart.plot(tree) 
```

We can also look inside of `tree` to see what we can unpack. "variable.importance" is one we should check out! 

```{r}
names(tree)
tree$variable.importance
```

In decision trees the main hyperparameter (configuration setting) is the **complexity parameter** (CP), but the name is a little counterintuitive; a high CP results in a simple decision tree with few splits, whereas a low CP results in a larger decision tree with many splits.  

`rpart` uses cross-validation internally to estimate the accuracy at various CP settings. We can review those to see what setting seems best.  

Print the results for various CP settings - we want the one with the lowest "xerror". We can also plot the performance estimates for different CP settings. 
```{r plotcp_tree}
# Show estimated error rate at different complexity parameter settings.
printcp(tree)

# Plot those estimated error rates.
plotcp(tree)

# Trees of similar sizes might appear to be tied for lowest "xerror", but a tree with fewer splits might be easier to interpret. However, a tree with 14 splits has a lower relative error. 
tree_pruned2 = prune(tree, cp = 0.0178) # 2 splits
tree_pruned14 = prune(tree, cp = 0.0100) # 14 splits

# Print detailed results, variable importance, and summary of splits.
```
```{r eval = F}
summary(tree_pruned2) 
```
```{r plot_tree_pruned2}
rpart.plot(tree_pruned2)
```
```{r eval = F}
summary(tree_pruned14) 
```
```{r plot_tree_pruned14}
rpart.plot(tree_pruned14)
```

You can also get more fine-grained control by checking out the "control" argument inside the rpart function. Type `?rpart` to learn more.  

**Big question 2:** What do you notice about the tree with 3 splits and the tree with 14 splits? Are there any parts that are identical?  

##### Challenge 2
What are the "minsplit", "cp", and "minbucket" hyperparameters within the "control" parameter? Use the iris dataset to construct a decision tree that utilizes the `rpart.control` hyperparameter.  

> HINT: the syntax might look like this: `ctrl = rpart.control(minsplit = 20, minbucket = 5, cp = 0.001)`
