# Machine learning defined

Machine learning evolved from scientific pursuits in statistics, computer science, information theory, artificial intelligence, and pattern recognition.  

How to define machine learning?  
1) **Generally:** algorithms, computers, and other machines that can "learn" without direct input from a human programmer.  
2) **Practically:** sets of tools for investigating/modeling/understanding data.  
3)  **Specifically:** (see below)

# Supervised machine learning

Selecting a machine learning algorithm depends on the characteristics of the problem being investigated - there is no "best" method applicable to all cases. Machine learning is generally divided into three broad classes of learning: [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), and [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).  

We will focus on **supervised learning** and will begin with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Lasso regression, followed by tree-based and ensemble classification methods. 

The syntax for supervised machine learning algorithms can be thought of like this:  

$y$ ~ $x_{1}$ + $x_{2}$ + $x_{3}$… $x_{n}$

$y$ is the dependent/response/target/outcome variable  
$x$ are the independent/input/predictor/feature/covariate variables  

Supervised machine learning methods learn a target function $f$ that best maps $x$ to $y$ based on a set of [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Training_dataset). 

---

# Supervised machine learning

Our function would look like this: $y = f(x) + \epsilon$ where $f$ is some function that relates our $x$ predictor variables to $y$ in an unknown way thus we must estimate it. Epsilon $\epsilon$ is the random error, is independent of $x$ and averages to zero. Therefore, we can predict $y$ using $\hat{y} = \hat{f}(x)$ for new data (the [test dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Test_dataset)) and evaluate how well the algorithm learned the target function when introduced to new data.  

**How to define machine learning, specifically? (revisited)**  
More specifically, we can think of machine learning as a bunch of methods to estimate $f$!  

---

# Classification or regression?

**Classification** is used when the $y$ outcome variable is categorical/discrete. Binary examples generally refer to a yes/no situation where a 1 is prediction of the "yes" category and 0 as the "no". Classification models the probability that the outcome variable is 1 based on the covariates: $Pr(y = 1 | x)$. This can be extended to multi-level classification as well.  

**Regression** is used when the target $y$ outcome variable is continuous. Regression models the conditional expectation (conditional mean) of the outcome variable given the covariates: $E(y | x)$.  

---

# Data preprocessing

A longstanding first step is to split a dataset into **"training"** and **"test"** subsets. A training sample usually consists of a majority of the original dataset so that an algorithm can learn the model. The remaining portion of the dataset is designated to the test sample to evaluate model performance on data the model has not yet seen. **Clean, subset, and handle missing data if necessary** before the splitting process commences.  

---

# Model performance

**Performance metrics** are used to see how well a model predicts a specified outcome on training and test datasets.  

A model that performs poorly on the training dataset is **underfit** because it is not able to discern relationships between the $x$ and $y$ variables.  

A model that performs well on the training dataset but poorly on the test dataset is said to be **overfit** because the model performed worse than expected when given new data. To some extent the patterns found in the training data may have been random noise and therefore, by random chance, are different in the test data.  

**Common performance metrics**: Accuracy, Mean squared error, Sensitivity and specificity, Area under the ROC curve (AUC)

# Specific workshop goals - heart disease dataset  

[Use the  heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) to investigate the following questions:  

1) **OLS and lasso regression examples:** How well can a person's age be predicted using the other heart disease-related variables?  

2) **Binary classification examples:** How reliably can different algorithms predict a person's heart disease status using the other variables?  

---

# Data preprocessing

A first task will be to split our data into training and test sets. This not only allows us to build a model on training data and evaluate its performance on test/holdout data, but it is also a good way to get familiar with cross-validation. 

The short version is that we need to:  
1. Define $y$ outcome and $x$ predictor variables  
2. Remove $y$ variable from $x$ predictor datasets  
3. Handle missing data (if present)  
4. Scale data (if necessary)  
5. Convert factors to indicators (if necessary)  
6. Define training and test datasets  

### Open "2-preprocessing.Rmd" to get started with the data.  

---

# Cross-validation

[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics%29) is a way to measure model performance of an entire dataset by repeating the splitting process _k_ number of times then combining/averaging performance across all iterations.

# What is regression? 

Regression analysis is a technique to infer the relationship between a $y$ outcome variable and $x$ predictor variable(s) and how much $y$ changes when $x$ is altered. 

This algorithm ["regresses"](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/207425/why-do-we-say-the-outcome-variable-is-regressed-on-the-predictors/207621) $y$ onto $x$. In simpler terminology we want to see how our $x$ variables can be used to predict $y$ for this example. 

Regression allows us to ask useful questions of our data, such as: 
1. Is there a relationship between $y$ and $x$? 
2. How strong are these relationships? 
3. How can $y$ be predicted for certain values of $x$? 
4. How well can the model be used to predict $y$ when new data are used? 

Simple (one $y$ and one $x$ variable) linear (relationship between parameters being estimated) regression can be thought of as the simplest form of supervised machine learning and can be used for both prediction and inference. 

---

# Regression syntax

The syntax for simple regression looks like this: $Y = β0 + β1x + ε$ 

$y$ = dependent/response/target/outcome variable  
$x$ = independent/input/predictor/feature/covariate variables  
$β0$ = intercept  
$β1x$ = slope for that particular feature  
epsilon  ${\epsilon}$ = error  

Remember that in multivariate regression, there is more than one $x$ variable. 

---

# Ordinary least squares example

[Ordinary least squares (OLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) regression is the simplest use case when the target $y$ variable is continuous. OLS computes a best fit line that minimizes the vertical squared and summed distances from each point to calculate the model's goodness of fit. This workshop's example will predict age from the [heart disesase dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) using the other variables as predictors.  

[Mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) are quick ways to evaluate performance. MSE measures the difference between observed and expected values, with smaller values indicative of greater predictive accuracy. The advantage of RMSE is that it can be easier to interpret and explain because it is on the same unit scale as the outcome variable we are predicting. 

Remember that under the hood, [`lm`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.2/topics/lm) is one-hot encoding factors to indicators, but [`model.matrix`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.2/topics/model.matrix) can be used to do so manually.  

Also be sure to [check out this blog post](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html) on how to fit and interpret linear models.

# Lasso

[Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics%29) is a form of variable selection regression that applies penalization to the coefficients through sparsity. It shrinks coefficients of the features that are not related to the outcome variable to zero, thus removing them to provide an ostensibly simpler model for interpretation.  

Sparsity: "Loosely speaking, a sparse statistical model is one in which only a relatively small number of parameters (or predictors) play an important role." (Hastie et al. 2016:1) aka a subset of the original variables. 

---

# Lasso

Lambda $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient, or the degree to which the beta coefficients should be penalized.  

When $\lambda$ is zero, ordinary least squares regression is performed. 

Alpha $\alpha$ determines the type of model; 1 indicates lasso penalty, 0 indicates ridge penalty, and anything inbetween indicates elastic net.  

Be sure to [read the glmnet vignette](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/Glmnet_Vignette.pdf).

# Decision trees

Decision trees are a standard alternative to linear regression and make no assumptions about the data; they split the data into smaller and smaller subgrioups of $x$ covariates in terms of $y$ and split on each predictor. How does it work? 

A decision tree predicts that an observation belongs to its correct class. 

For basic classification, we are no longer using MSE or RMSE but instead classification error rate. 

To determine the top split ("root node"), the model looks at all cutpoints to see which group stands out as the best split. The "complexity parameter" can be used to [prune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_pruning) the tree to a lesser number of splits and removes unnecessary information. 

Breiman et al's book [Classification and Regression Trees (1984)](https://www.amazon.com/Classification-Regression-Wadsworth-Statistics-Probability/dp/0412048418) is a must read for learning more about decision trees.

# Random forest

The random forest algorithm seeks to improve on the performance of a single decision tree by taking the average of many trees. Thus, a random forest can be viewed as an **ensemble** method, or model averaging approach.  

Random forests are 
- **random** because each tree is a bagged sample _and_ because only a subset of all predictors (the **mtry** hyperparameter) are used as candidates at each split (not all predictors like single decision trees)
  - This reduced number of predictor candidates at each split allows for something other than the best split to be the top split, thus growing many different looking trees - this "decorrelates" the trees.  
- **forests** because many trees are grown!

Leo Breiman also wrote the seminal paper on random forests:

# XGBoost

Boosting takes this ensemble idea a step further! The XGBoost algorithm takes a bunch of weak trees and "boosts" them insto strong trees. This algorithm downweights cases it can easily predict but upweights the cases it has trouble predicting. 

This is not teleological though, as boosting fits a forest of trees sequentially on the residual of the previous tree. This learning rate can be specified, or how fast each tree should learn the error of the previous tree. Here we also introduce:  
- `caret::trainControl` for defining cross-validation (rather than bootstrap) settings  
- `caret::expand.grid` for creating a grid search of hyperparameters to tune, allowing us to fit multiple combinations of the algoritihm simultaneously. 
- *A*rea *U*nder the Receiver Operating Characteristic *C*urve (AUC) as a performance metric.

# SuperLearner

The SuperLearner R package takes this idea of ensembling even further! Instead of ensembling only trees-based methods, we can simultaneously compare the cross-validated performance of multiple algorithms and/or a single algorithm with differently tuned hyperparameters. This is a generally advisable approach to machine learning instead of fitting single algorithms. 

Let's compare the algorithms you have previously fitted individually in this workshop: lasso, decision tree, random forest, and xgboost. We will add two other algorithms for fun: logistic regression and the mean of our Y response variable. 

- **Risk:** is a performance estimate - it's the average loss, and loss is how far off the prediction was for an individual observation. Lower is better! 
- **Discrete.SL:** the singled best-performing algorithm. 
- **Super Learner:** the weighted ensemble average algorithm comprised of a combination of our selected algorithms. 
- **SL.glm_All:** logistic regression (`glm`); one of the most common algorithms across scientific disciplines. 
- **SL.mean_All:** the mean of our Y response variable; this is the simplest algorithm and should perform the worst of all.

# Principal component analysis

The previous methods we have examined are supervised - they are used to predict some $y$ outcome variable based on $x$ predictors. Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised method, which does not use any $y$ variable for supervision but instead sorts the data based _only_ on the $x$ variables. PCA and other ordintation/dimension reduction techniques are helpful for optimizing other machine learning algorithms. 

PCA is a powerful linear transformation technique used to explore patterns in data and highly correlated variables. It is useful for distilling variation into "components" across many variables onto a reduced feature space, such as a two or three-dimensional scatterplot. Axis loadings can then be extracted to see which variables contribute most to variation along each component.

# Hierarchical agglomerative clustering

Hierarchical agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up approach. Each observation begins as its own cluster and forms clusters with like items as it moves up the hierarchy. That is, all leaves are their own clusters to begin with and form clusters as grouping moves up the trunk and various branches are formed.  

Distance and cluster method information are usually displayed at the bottom of the graph, while the vertical axis displays the height, which refers to the distance between clusters. We can also "cut" the dendrogram to specify a number of clusters, which is similar to defining _k_ in k-means clustering (which can also be problematic).
