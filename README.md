## Getting started

Please follow the notes in [participant-instructions.md](participant-instructions.md).

## Assumed participant background

We assume that participants have familiarity with:

* basic R syntax
* statistical concepts such as mean and standard deviation

## Technology requirements

Please bring a laptop with the following:

* [R version](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
3.5 or greater
* [RStudio integrated development environment (IDE)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) is
highly recommended but not required.

## Resources

Browse resources listed on the [D-Lab Machine Learning Working Group repository](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/MachineLearningWG). Scroll down to see code examples in R and Python, books, courses at UC Berkeley, online classes, and other resources and groups to help you along your machine learning journey!  

## Slideshow

The slides were made using [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), which is a wrapper for [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1). Check out Chapter 7 if you are interested in making your own! The theme borrows from Brad Boehmke's presentation on [Decision Trees, Bagging, and Random Forests - with an example implementation in R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/random-forest-training/slides-source.html#1).
