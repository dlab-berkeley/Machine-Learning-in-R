# Preprocessing

## Load packages

Explicitly load the packages that we need for this analysis.

```{r packages, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
library(rio) # painless data import and export
library(tidyverse) # tidyverse packages 
library(tidymodels) # tidymodels framework 
library(here) # reproducible way to find files 
```

## Load the data

Load the heart disease dataset. 

```{r load_data}
# Load the heart disease dataset using import() from the rio package.
data_original <- import(here("data-raw", "heart.csv"))

# Preserve the original copy
data <- data_original

# Inspect 
glimpse(data)

class(data)
```

## Machine learning workflow 

- Before diving into the specific problem (i.e., preprocessing), let's take a step back and think about the big picture.

![A schematic for the typical modeling process (from Tidy Modeling with R)](https://www.tmwr.org/premade/modeling-process.svg)


- Preprocessing happens between the EDA and the initial feature engineering. 


![Based on https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/](https://i.vas3k.ru/7r8.jpg)


- Data (e.g., text, image, and video) and Features (the dimensions of a numeric vector) are different!


## Why taking a tidyverse approach to machine learning?

### Benefits 
- Readable code (e.g., `dplyr` is quite intuitive even for beginning R users.)
- Reusable data structures (e.g., `broom` package helps to visualize model outputs, such as p-value, using `ggplot2`)
- Extendable code (e.g., you can easily build a machine learning pipeline by using the pipe operator (`%>%`) and the `purrr` package)

### tidymodels 

- Like `tidyverse`, `tidymodels` is a collection of packages.

    - [`rsample`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/): for data splitting 
    
    - [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/index.html): for pre-processing
    
    - [`parsnip`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/11/parsnip-0-0-1/): for model building 
    
        - [`tune`](https://github.com/tidymodels/tune): parameter tuning 
    
    - [`yardstick`](https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick): for model evaluations 
    
    - [`workflows`](https://github.com/tidymodels/workflows): for bundling a pieplne that bundles together pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing requests 

## Data preprocessing

Data peprocessing is an integral first step in machine learning workflows. Because different algorithms sometimes require the moving parts to be coded in slightly different ways, always make sure you research the algorithm you want to implement so that you properly setup your $y$ and $x$ variables and split your data appropriately. 

> NOTE: also, use the `save` function to save your variables of interest. In the remaining walkthroughs, we will use the `load` function to load the relevant variables. 

The list of the preprocessing steps draws on the vignette of the [`parsnip`](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/) package.

- dummy: Also called one-hot encoding
- zero variance: Removing columns (or features) with a single unique value  
- impute: Imputing missing values
- decorrelate: Mitigating correlated predictors (e.g., principal component analysis)
- normalize: Centering and/or scaling predictors (e.g., log scaling)
- transform: Making predictors symmetric 

In this workshop, we focus on two preprocessing tasks. 

### Task 1: What is one-hot encoding?

One additional preprocessing aspect to consider: datasets that contain factor (categorical) features should typically be expanded out into numeric indicators (this is often referred to as [one-hot encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f). You can do this manually with the `model.matrix` R function. This makes it easier to code a variety of algorithms to a dataset as many algorithms handle factors poorly (decision trees being the main exception). Doing this manually is always good practice. In general however, functions like `lm` will do this for you automatically. 

- Since the "ca", "cp", "slope", and "thal" features are currently integer type, convert them to factors. The other relevant variables are either continuous or are already indicators (just 1's and 0's). 

```{r}

# Turn selected numeric variables into factor variables 
data <- data %>%
  mutate(across(c("sex", "ca", "cp", "slope", "thal"), as.factor)) 

```

### Task 2: Handling missing data

Missing values need to be handled somehow. Listwise deletion (deleting any row with at least one missing value) is common but this method throws out a lot of useful information. Many advocate for mean imputation, but arithmetic means are sensitive to outliers. Still, others advocate for Chained Equation/Bayesian/Expectation Maximization imputation (e.g., the [mice](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v045i03/v45i03.pdf) and [Amelia II](https://gking.harvard.edu/amelia) R packages). K-nearest neighbor imputation can also be useful but median imputation is used in this workshop.  

However, you will want to learn about [Generalized Low Rank Models](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf) for missing data imputation in your research. See the `impute_missing_values` function from the ck37r package to learn more - you might need to install an h2o dependency.  

First, count the number of missing values across variables in our dataset.  

- Using base R 

```{r review_missingness base}

# Using base R; The output is a numeric vector.  
colSums(is.na(data))

class(colSums(is.na(data)))

```

- Using tidyverse 

```{r review_missingness tidyverse}

# Using tidyverse; The output is a dataframe.
# Option 1 and Option 2 produce same outputs. 

map_df(data, ~ is.na(.) %>% sum()) # Option 1

map_df(data, 
       function(x){is.na(x) %>% sum()}) %>% # Option 2 
  as_tibble()

```

We have no missing values, so let's introduce a few to the "oldpeak" feature for this example to see how it works: 

```{r}

# Add five missing values added to oldpeak in row numbers 50, 100, 150, 200, 250

data$oldpeak[c(50, 100, 150, 200, 250)] <- NA

```

There are now 5 missing values in the "oldpeak" feature.

```{r}

# Check the number of missing values 
data %>%
  map_df(~is.na(.) %>% sum())

# Check the rate of missing values
data %>%
  map_df(~is.na(.) %>% mean())

```

## Preprocessing workflow 

![Art by Allison Horst](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/conf20-intro-ml/recipes.png)

- Step 1: `recipe()` defines target and predictor variables (ingredients).

- Step 2: `step_*()` defines preprocessing steps to be taken (recipe).

- Step 3: `prep()` prepares a dataset to base each step on.

- Step 4: `bake()` applies the pre-processing steps to your datasets.

## Regressioin setup 

Splitting data into training and test subsets is a fundamental step in machine learning. Usually, the marjority portion of the original dataset is partitioned to the training set, where the algorithms learn the relationships between the $x$ feature predictors and the $y$ outcome variable. Then, these models are given new data (the test set) to see how well they perform on data they have not yet seen. 

Since **age** is a **continuous variable** and will be **the outcome** for the OLS and lasso regressions, we will not perform a stratified random split like we will for the classification tasks (see below). Instead, [let's randomly assign](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17200114/how-to-split-data-into-training-testing-sets-using-sample-function) 70% of the `age` values to the training set and the remaining 30% to the test set.

### Outcome variable 

```{r}

# Continuous variable 
data$age %>% unique()

```
### Data splitting using random sampling 

Take the simple approach to data splitting and divide our data into training and test sets; 70% of the data will be assigned to the training set and the remaining 30% will be assigned to the holdout, or test, set.

```{r}

# for reproducibility 
set.seed(1234) 

# split 
split_reg <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.7)

# training set 
raw_train_x_reg <- training(split_reg)

# test set 
raw_test_x_reg <- testing(split_reg)

```

### recipe 

```{r}

# Regression recipe 
rec_reg <- raw_train_x_reg %>%
  # Define the outcome variable 
  recipe(age ~ .) %>%
  # Median impute oldpeak column 
  step_medianimpute(oldpeak) %>%
  # Expand "sex", "ca", "cp", "slope", and "thal" features out into dummy variables (indicators). 
  step_dummy(c("sex", "ca", "cp", "slope", "thal"))

# Prepare a dataset to base each step on
prep_reg <- rec_reg %>% prep(retain = TRUE) 

```

```{r}

# x features 
train_x_reg <- juice(prep_reg, all_predictors()) 
test_x_reg <- bake(prep_reg, raw_test_x_reg, all_predictors())

# y variables 
train_y_reg <- juice(prep_reg, all_outcomes())$age %>% as.numeric()
test_y_reg <- bake(prep_reg, raw_test_x_reg, all_outcomes())$age %>% as.numeric()

# Checks
names(train_x_reg) # Make sure there's no age variable!
class(train_y_reg) # Make sure this is a continuous variable!

```

- Note that other imputation methods are also available. Fancier methods tend to take longer time than simpler ones such as mean, median, or mode imputation. 

```{r}
grep("impute", ls("package:recipes"), value = TRUE)
```

- You can also create your own `step_` functions. For more information, see [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/recipes/).

- Now that the data have been imputed and properly converted, we can assign the regression outcome variable (`age`) to its own vector for the lasso **REGRESSION task**. Remember that lasso can also perform classification as well. 

## Classification setup 

Assign the outcome variable to its own vector for the decision tree, random forest, gradient boosted tree, and SuperLearner ensemble **CLASSIFICATION tasks**. However, keep in mind that these algorithms can also perform regression!  

This time however, **"target"** will by our y **outcome variable** (1 = person has heart disease, 0 = person does not have heart disease) - the others will be our x features. 

### Outcome variable 

```{r}

## Categorical variable 
data$target %>% unique()

```
### Data splitting using stratified random sampling

For classification, we then use [stratified random sampling](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/250273/benefits-of-stratified-vs-random-sampling-for-generating-training-data-in-classi) to divide our data into training and test sets; 70% of the data will be assigned to the training set and the remaining 30% will be assigned to the holdout, or test, set. 

```{r}

# split 
split_class <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.7, strata = target)

# training set 
raw_train_x_class <- training(split_class)

# testing set 
raw_test_x_class <- testing(split_class)

```

### recipe 

```{r}

# Classification recipe 
rec_class <- raw_train_x_class %>% 
  # Define the outcome variable 
  recipe(target ~ .) %>%
  # Median impute oldpeak column 
  step_medianimpute(oldpeak) %>%
  # Expand "sex", "ca", "cp", "slope", and "thal" features out into dummy variables (indicators). 
  step_dummy(c("sex", "ca", "cp", "slope", "thal")) 

# Prepare a dataset to base each step on
prep_class <- rec_class %>%prep(retain = TRUE) 

```

```{r}

# x features 
train_x_class <- juice(prep_class, all_predictors()) 
test_x_class <- bake(prep_class, raw_test_x_class, all_predictors())

# y variables 
train_y_class <- juice(prep_class, all_outcomes())$target %>% as.factor()
test_y_class <- bake(prep_class, raw_test_x_class, all_outcomes())$target %>% as.factor()

# Checks 
names(train_x_class) # Make sure there's no target variable!
class(train_y_class) # Make sure this is a factor variable!

```

### Save our preprocessed data

We save our preprocessed data into an RData file so that we can easily load it the later files.

```{r save_data}
save(data, data_original, # data 
     rec_reg, rec_class, # recipes 
     prep_reg, prep_class, # preps 
     train_x_reg, train_y_reg, # train sets 
     test_x_reg, test_y_reg, # test sets 
     train_x_class, train_y_class, # train sets 
     test_x_class, test_y_class, # test
     file = here("data", "preprocessed.RData"))
```
